    fullDescription: 'I have extensive experience managing and automating cloud infrastructure on AWS and OVH to ensure seamless platform operations. I architected and deployed a containerized health check application on AWS using ECS Fargate, SQS, VPC, and CloudWatch, enhancing it with asynchronous request handling for improved performance. The entire infrastructure provisioning for this application was fully automated using Terraform and GitHub Actions.  I successfully migrated SSL certificate management from Traefik to Certbot for over 3000 active servers, developing complex Bash scripts to convert existing certificates. In another initiative, I seamlessly replaced the Traefik reverse proxy with Nginx across all servers using Ansible. To bolster security, I integrated Oauth2 Proxy as a middleware to protect multiple web applications with robust authentication.  I developed a custom, lightweight system to asynchronously monitor server vitals (CPU, RAM, disk usage), providing automated email alerts via AWS SES during sustained high loads. I also engineered an external database integration, enabling Odoo users on our platform to connect with their custom databases.',

    fullDescription: 'I manage AWS cloud infrastructure and have successfully automated workflows across teams, resulting in a 40% reduction in deployment time and cost, while also enhancing collaboration efficiency across three departments. I have researched and integrated an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solution for a PHP application based on a Yii2 legacy project, with the integrated monitoring tool now being used by over 10 developers. This integration has significantly enhanced observability, improving uptime by 25% and reducing response time by 30%. Additionally, I streamlined workflow automation across various environments, saving 20 hours per month by minimising manual tasks and enhancing productivity through effective tooling. Furthermore, I have optimised Docker images for better security and reduced sizes, further contributing to the overall efficiency and security of our development and deployment processes.',
